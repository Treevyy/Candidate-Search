  ## Description
The Candidate Search Application is a dynamic React project enhanced with TypeScript that empowers employers to quickly and reliably review candidate profiles sourced from the GitHub API. By leveraging a custom API endpoint to retrieve GitHub user data, the application displays key information including the candidate's name, username, location, avatar, email, GitHub profile URL, and company. Employers can easily save promising candidates by clicking the "+" button, skip profiles with the "-" button, and view a persisted list of accepted candidates. As a bonus, additional features like sorting and filtering potential candidates may be implemented to further streamline the hiring process.

  ## Usage
  To run the Candidate Search:

  2. When the candidate search page loads, it displays one candidate's details (name, username, location, avatar, email, GitHub profile URL, and company).

  3. Click the "+" button to save the current candidate and load the next candidateâ€™s information.

  4. Click the "- button" to skip the current candidate without saving and display the next candidate.

  5. View the list of saved candidates, which persists via local storage.

  6. If no candidates have been saved or if there are no candidates available to review, the application will display an appropriate message.

  7. Optionally, sort and filter the list of potential candidates to further refine your hiring process.
